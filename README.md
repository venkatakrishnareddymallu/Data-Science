# GRAMENER-ENTRY-LEVEL-PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
<br>THIS EXERCISE INVOLVES AN EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS ON NATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT SURVEY ON CLASS  VIII STUDENTS FROM 2014<br>
AIM OF THE EXERCISE IS TO FIND THE FOLLOWING INSIGHTS FROM THE DATA<br>
1.WHAT INFLUECES THE STUDENT PERFORMANCE THE MOST <br>
2.HOW DO BOYS AND GIRLS PERFORM ACCROSS STATES <br>
3.DOES STUDENTS FROM SOUTH INDIAN STATES REALLY EXCEL IN MATHS AND SCIENCE 

LIBRARIES USED IN THIS EXERCISE ARE<br>
NUMPY<br>
PANDAS<br>
SEABORN<br>
MATPLOTLIB<br>


1.INITIALLY DATA IS CLEANED BECAUSE THE NUMERICAL VALUES DOESN'T MAKE DURING VISUALIZATION<br>
2.TRANSFORMED AND AGGREGATED THE DATA USING GROUPBY FUNCTION IN PANDAS <br>
3.TO ANSWER FIRST QUESTION CONSIDER EVERY ATTRIBUTE IN DATASET AS A FACTOR THAT INFLUENCES THE STUDENTS PERFORMANCE<br>
4.BY USING GROUPBY  AGGREGATE THE MARKS BASED ON EACH ATTRIBUTE AND THEN CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM MARKS IN EACH SUBJECT ON THAT PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTE.THE DIFFERENCE IN MARKS ENABLES TO UNDERSTAND THAT HOW THAT PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTE CAN EFFECT THE STUDENT AND VISUALIZED USING HEATMAP BECAUSE HEATMAP COMES WITH VISUALIZED DATAFRAME THAT ENABLES THE BEST USER EXPERIENCE VISUALIZATION <br>
5.FINALLY I COMBINED ALL THE HEATMAPS OF THE CALCULATED DIFFERENCE OF MARKS BASED ON PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTE<br>


6.TO ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION PASS BOOLEAN DATA TYPE IN NESTED LIST ASSINING SPECIFIC GENDER <br>
7.USING MATPLOTLIB TO VISUALIZE THE GENDER MARKS ACCROSS STATES<br>
8.NOW CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GENDER TO KNOW WHO PERFORMS BETTER ACCROSS STATES<br>
9.VISUALIZING THE DIFFERENCE IN MARKS BASED ON GENDER ACROSS STATES<br>


10.CREATE A NEW COLUMN  ZONE AND MAPPNG STATES TO APPROPRIATE ZONES AND AGGREGATE THE MATHS MARKS AND SCIENCE MARKS BY ZONE <br>
11.VISUALIZING THE RESULTS
